# Split Connectivity

**Split Connectivity** is a dynamic web application designed to demonstrate real-time interactions and visualizations using Next.js, React, and Socket.IO. The application features a unique interface where multiple browser windows can connect, communicate, and display synchronized animations and data visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Window Movement**: Browser windows can move around the screen dynamically, creating an engaging and interactive user experience.
- **Visual Data Representation**: Displays data using visually appealing components such as spheres and links, with animations and transitions.
- **Styled Components**: Leverages styled-components for modular and maintainable CSS-in-JS styling.
- **Pastel Color Generation**: Generates distinct pastel colors for visual elements to ensure a pleasing and consistent aesthetic.
- **Cross-Window Synchronization**: Ensures that data and animations are synchronized across multiple connected browser windows.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time web applications.
- **Styled-Components**: A library for writing CSS-in-JS.
